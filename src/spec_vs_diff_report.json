  "summary": "The diff adds a new Account Status “Publishing & Deployment” help card and updates AccountStatusPage to render it. It also extends PrePublishGateCard with a post-deploy verification checklist data structure and adds a troubleshooting scroll helper, but several acceptance-criteria details cannot be confirmed due to truncation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Include a checklist for when a deploy succeeds but changes are not visible: hard refresh, reset app cache, disable offline cache/service worker.",
      "reason": "The new help section shows sections for deploying and retrying failed deployments, but the portion that should contain the full post-success checklist is truncated and the required items (reset app cache; disable offline cache/service worker) are not visible in the provided diff excerpt.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/account/PublishingDeploymentHelpSection.tsx (truncated after starting the 'What to Do When UI Doesn't Update After Successful Deploy' section)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Provide a direct link/button that scrolls/navigates to the existing Troubleshooting tools on the Account Status page (or uses #troubleshooting anchor).",
      "reason": "A scrollToTroubleshooting() helper exists, but the diff excerpt does not show any rendered link/button that calls it (the render is truncated before the end of the component).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/account/PublishingDeploymentHelpSection.tsx (defines scrollToTroubleshooting, but rendered button/link not shown in excerpt due to truncation)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Show a dedicated 'Post-deploy verification' subsection in Pre-Publish Gate with 3–5 checkboxes and English copy noting to use Troubleshooting if verification fails due to caching, plus a link/button to Troubleshooting.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a POST_DEPLOY_VERIFICATION array with 5 checkbox labels and a scrollToTroubleshooting() function, but the rendered JSX that would display the subsection, the explanatory note, and the link/button is not visible because the file is truncated.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/account/PrePublishGateCard.tsx (POST_DEPLOY_VERIFICATION defined; scrollToTroubleshooting defined; UI rendering truncated)"
